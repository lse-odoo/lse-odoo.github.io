My name is Loan (known internally in Odoo as LSE) and I'm a software engineer. I'm passionate about technology and I love to share my knowledge with others.
I have been working in Odoo since October 2019 as a Software Engineer/Technical Support.

Throughout my years at Odoo, I have discovered various interesting elements, including trivia, techniques, and tips that I would like to share with you.

This website does not aim to replace `Odoo documentation <https://www.odoo.com/documentation/>`_,
but to complement it with some practical explanations that may not be covered there.
