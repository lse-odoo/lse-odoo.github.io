.. tags:: iot box incompatible, virtual iot compatible

On Windows virtual IoT, you can get the IoT logs manually easily.
The file is saved at the same location where you installed odoo in the ``server`` folder.
There is one file which will contains every logs of the IoT named ``odoo.log``.

.. note::
   Windows might hide the file extension, so the file will be named ``odoo`` and be listed as a ``Text Document``.
