IoT-box Password (IoT)
======================

.. tags:: iot box compatible, virtual iot incompatible

Depending on your IoT-box version, the password value/generation process may differ.

Oldest IoT-boxes will always have a fixed password: **raspberry**.

Newest version will generate a new random password each time the IoT-box is rebooted.
While there is no way to know this password, you can generate a new known one on-demand.

Get/Generate a new password
===========================

Steps:
------

1. Connect to your IoT-box homepage (using the link on the IoT app)

    .. note::
        If you don't have this field, you are on an old version of the IoT-box and the password is fixed to ``raspberry``.
