The structure and the way the code update is complicated with the IoT.
As it is different for the windows virtual IoT it will be explained in a different section.

`Odoo's IoT Update documentation <https://www.odoo.com/documentation/17.0/applications/general/iot/config/updating_iot.html>`_
already covered vaguely the structure of the IoT-box, but I will go more in-depth here.
